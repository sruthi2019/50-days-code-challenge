Household Energy Consumption Analysis

This project analyzes household energy usage patterns to help cities design subsidy schemes and promote energy efficiency.

Dataset:

Household_ID – Unique household identifier

Family_Size – Number of family members

Monthly_Income – Household income

Electricity_Usage (kWh) – Monthly electricity consumption

Gas_Usage – Monthly gas consumption

Appliances_Count – Number of appliances

Month – Month of data recording

Analysis Goals:

Understand energy consumption patterns across households.

Identify which household types (by family size, income, or appliances) consume the most energy.

Suggest energy-saving measures for high-energy households.

Visualize insights using PivotTables, charts, and dashboards in Excel.

Key Insights:

Larger families and households with more appliances use more energy.

High-income households consume more electricity due to higher appliance ownership.

Seasonal trends show electricity peaks in summer and gas peaks in winter.

Outcomes:

Targeted subsidies for energy-efficient appliances and solar adoption.

Awareness campaigns for efficient energy usage.

Policy design based on household type and seasonal demand.

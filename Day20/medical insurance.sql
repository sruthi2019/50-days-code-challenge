# Tasks
# 1. Find the total number of insurance records
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM medical_insurance;

# 2. Retrieve the details of all smokers above age 400
SELECT * FROM medical_insurance WHERE smoker = 'Yes' AND age > 40;

# 3. Count how many male and female policyholders exist in the dataset
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS total FROM medical_insurance GROUP BY gender;

# 4. Calculate the average insurance cost of smokers vs. non-smokers.
SELECT smoker, AVG(insurance_cost) AS avg_cost FROM medical_insurance GROUP BY smoker;

# 5. Find the region with the highest average insurance cost.
SELECT region, AVG(insurance_cost) AS avg_cost FROM medical_insurance GROUP BY region ORDER BY avg_cost DESC LIMIT 1;

# 6. List the top 5 policyholders who paid the highest insurance cost.

# o Young (18–30), Middle-aged (31–50), Senior (51+).

# 8. Identify if smokers with BMI > 30 are paying significantly higher insurance than nonsmokers.

# 9. Find the correlation-like insights (not actual correlation in SQL, but using GROUP BY) 
# o Avg cost by number of children.
